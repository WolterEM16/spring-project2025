BaronClash is a small personal project I am working on. The main focus of my product is to teach new players with post-game match-up tips. BaronClash will study the players gameplay and patterns to give accurate advice on how to approach every champion. The product with get its tips and advice through machine learning and pro-player stats. The APIs I will be using are: match, summoner, and champion. BaronClash is still in a very early stage of development. I'm hoping to build and learn in the hopes of making League of Legends more fun and interesting for new summoners.
